# Raul Annaloro's resume

A lightweight, print‑ready résumé built with **pure HTML + CSS**.

> **Author’s note** — This curriculum was created **entirely by me**. I reused and adapted visual patterns and theme ideas from my own project **AgonActive**, which I’m actively working on.

## Highlights
- **No JavaScript**: zero scripts, just clean HTML/CSS.
- **Responsive**: scales nicely from mobile to desktop.
- **Print‑ready**: `Ctrl/Cmd + P` → “Save as PDF” (A4 optimized).
- **Accessible structure**: semantic headings, lists, and ARIA labels.
- **Auto theme**: respects the system’s `prefers-color-scheme` (no toggle needed).

## Structure
```
index.html   # résumé content
style.css    # theme, layout, print styles
README.md    # this file
```

## Credits
Design & code by **Raul Annaloro**.  
Theme elements adapted from **AgonActive** (my personal project).
